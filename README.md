## Stack: MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js

An independent coding project for my resume, serving as a replica of the widely used platform Discord

## Ideas (check when completed)

- ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖBreak up screen into 5 parts just like Discord (narrow left side bar, left list of channels, main chat area, list of users, and small little bar the left w settings and stuff)
*will work on when I can display a freaking message*‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ

- Figure out how to display new inputted message on frontend server instead of backend *should probably be somewhat easy maybe idk*

- *Eventually* rearrange routes into routes and controller files like in node project called "twilltch" to help w organization (and follow mvc paradigms) *need to figure out how to do in Angular*

- Write something about RESTful apis in resume once you get it to work more --> might look good to resume ppl

- Should I add delete functionality to messages? I really don't want to because that would maybe take time? would it really though?
like it could be just a button where it Deletes it from the collection and it refreshes the page? would it really be that hard? would Update / edit button be hypothetically that easy as well? I could put something about CRUD it in my resume... (would it really be that good though?)

- ideas for server names: 

    - server1
        - Skewl or something??? (I hate skewl)
            - updates on whether hell is frozen over or not???

    - server2
        - Gym or something?

    - server3
        - Some sort of boys only / no girls allowed club

## Timeline  

- 8/10/2023

    - Initialized Angular + Node parts + pushed to GitHub

    - Current issue: trying to find the smallest part of having Node and Angular talk to one another

- 8/11/2023

    - Combed through freeCodeCamp (fCC) video to how to connect Angular and Node and eventually found out how to

    - Decided a good first goal is to create the message bar

    - Need to do to finish 1st little message box:
        - Make index.js route, make app.js talk to Angular
        - Fix onSubmit() error in message-box.component.html
        - Working @ 54:41 in freeCodeCamp video

- 8/12/2023

    - **Fixed onSubmit() error in message-box.component.html**

    - Set up backend server

    - Trying to make app.js talk to Angular but running into a problem in testroute.js titled "MessageSchema is not a constructor". Tomorrow I am planning on combing through more of the fCC video to see how the guy manages it, maybe that will help?

    - Looking more into the issue, working theory is issue w MongoDB
    setup

- 8/13/2023

    - Looking more into issue w MongoDB. Tried lots and lots of things but still
    making seemingly no progress. Will hopefully work on again a little later today

    - Update: got it to not give an error.
    However, it is still not displaying on 
    localhost3000/test, which is strange. Will do even more digging later.
    
    - Update 2: working through a specific part of code that appears to be making it display to the screen under certain conditions. Currently investigating similar parts in other projects to see what I can replicate

    - (When I submit a thing in the message box and refresh the page, a new message displays in the backend along with 
    the rest of the messages)

    - Still need to figure out how to get the actual new message to display though...

    - Still working on req.body.text is undefined problem...
    
- 8/15/2023
    - **Fixed weird glitch where .env was still able to be seen (command: git rm --cached .env)**

    - Next small problem: figure out why exports.post in messageController is not being read (might help with req.body.text)
    (or we could like just focus on req.body.text)

    - Update on both exports.post and req.body.text problems: with req.body.text, it has to be inside of a post request, not a get request, and with exports.post you have to use an outside source (Postman in this case) to read post requests for some reason

    - Still need to figure out how to display it on the frontend tho

    - Started work on organization of frontend. Current task is trying to figure out how to put the send message button right beside the input message form

    - Update: made tremendous progress of organizing main frontend page. Next task is of couse putting the send message button right beside the input message form

- 8/16/2023
    - Less time today bc coming back home & haircut & shopping

    - Found out how to do the thing where the main box fills both the left and right sides. Next step: resize message box to be similar to discord and also figure out how to get "send message"
    button to display next to message box

- 8/17/2023
    - Less time today bc marching band camp, but still made some progress

    - Made content box component (main area where messages will be displayed) and made ui closer to discords ui (only really works on my laptop screens display tho)
