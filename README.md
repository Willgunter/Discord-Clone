## Stack: MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js

Personal coding project for school that is a replica of popular app Discord, by me, Will Gunter

## Ideas

- Break up screen into 5 parts just like Discord (narrow left side bar, left list of channels, main chat area, list of users, and small little bar the left w settings and stuff)

    - Combed through freeCodeCamp video to how to connect Angular and Node and eventually found out how to
    - Decided a good first goal is to create the message bar
    - Need to do to finish 1st little message box:
        - Make index.js route, make app.js talk to Angular
        - Fix onSubmit() error in message-box.component.html
