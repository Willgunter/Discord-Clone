**temp file** WILL DELETE WHEN I AM DONE

1 - create a post request for the user in app.js that corresponds to the submit form in the sign-up page (don't forget to sanitize + validate later!!)

2 - use Passport.js to do something??? --> what does it *not* do??? --> passport.use function

 - serialize + deserialize??

 - all have to be **before** app.use(passport.initialize())

3 - app.post --> something login?
